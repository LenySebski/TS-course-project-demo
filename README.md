# Drag and Drop Project manager

App which focuses on creating and moving 'projects' between two project-lists with use of drag and drop events. Created with use of TS and HTML templates in OOP approach.

During work on this project I've learned a lot about types, interfaces, generics,decorators,classes and also about config files for webpack and typescript.
